tech_living_metal_cristal:0 "Living Metal cristalization"
tech_living_metal_cristal_desc:0 "With our latest technologies it might be possible to create living matal in vats, for industrial use. Surely is worth investigating."
tech_nanite_foundries:0 "Nanite Foundries"
tech_nanite_foundries_desc:0 "We must investigate the possibillity of automating nanite production. Yet as of our current knowledge it will be a costy and inefficient process."
tech_nanite_hatcheries:0 "Nanite hatcheries"
tech_nanite_hatcheries_desc:0 "Why spend time and effeort in making nanites when you can make them replicate by themselves? We just have to create fitting factory desings and then feed them raw materials."
tech_HCL:0 "Hyper Custodian Loop"
tech_HCL_desc:0 "If gateways are a car, this is the ferrari of transportation. This is the ultimate form of transport, it allows acces to the dematerialization circuit. From one end of the galaxy to the other in an instant.....WHAT DO YOU MEAN CUSTODIAN WAS ALLREADY USED AS A NAME?"
tech_seed_p2:0 "Seeding project II"
tech_seed_p2_desc:0 "The next step for the seeding Project would be to find adequate materials for the nanites. Common alloys will not resist to the pressure of duplication and provide enough flexibility."
tech_huon_thrusters:0 "Huon Thrusters"
tech_huon_thrusters_desc:0 "One application of Huon particles is to use them to power drives, which would increase the to speed of any ship greatlyy compared to the impulse thrusters."
tech_time_lock_eng:0 "Time locked reactor"
tech_time_lock_eng_desc:0 "Think of a reactor, containing a highly energetic nuclear fusion, one that under normal conditions would be unstable like a bomb. Now suspend the explosion in time, and harvest the constant ourflow of energy. Congrats, you have just imagined a time locked reactor. Basically, infinite energy at no cost, but warning breaches in the suspension apparatus may conduct to catastrophic failures."
tech_code_tryon:0 "Codename: Tryon"
tech_code_tryon_desc:0 "We are here at last. We now only have to put the pieces together and design a containment field big enough for our sphere of knowledge. Greatness is destined to those who take risks."
tech_hyper_coms_scrambler:0 "Hyper Comms-Scrambler"
tech_hyper_coms_scrambler_desc:0 "Now, even if we are cut off from the rest of the galaxy, we can still be heard. And the little they hear might be enough to wake jealousy, and jealousy will bring people to research mean to get to us. We have to make sure our communications are never heard again after we break the Hyperlanes. They will have to think we all disapeared with the breaking of the Hyperlanes. Though some might not believe us gone, they will forget or accept that we are gone, if they never intercept our communications. For prolongued stability this mesure will be in both directions, we will never hear them again either."
